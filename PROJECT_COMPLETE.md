## 🚀 Your Unique Value Proposition

**AEEIA is the first prediction market oracle that uses AI to BOTH discover AND process data sources, with ZERO hardcoded APIs.**

### Traditional Oracles
```
Question: "Will Bitcoin exceed $100,000 by March 31, 2026?"
❌ Hardcoded: [CoinGecko, Binance, Kraken]
❌ Cannot handle news questions
❌ Cannot handle social questions
❌ Requires manual updates
```

### AEEIA (Your Project)
```
Question: "Will Bitcoin exceed $100,000 by March 31, 2026?"
✅ AI discovers: [CoinGecko, Binance, CoinCap, Coinbase, Kraken]
✅ DON consensus on sources (5/7 nodes must agree)
✅ Byzantine Fault Tolerant (4/5 sources must agree)

Question: "Did SpaceX launch Starship before March 15, 2026?"
✅ AI discovers: [Reuters article, AP News, SpaceX Twitter, NASA feed, Space.com]
✅ AI processes each source (reads articles, extracts facts)
✅ Returns: TRUE with 88% confidence
```

## 📋 Next Steps to Submit

### 1. **Record Demo Video** (5-7 minutes)
**Demo Script:**
1. **Intro (30s)** - "I'm showing AEEIA, an AI-powered prediction market oracle"
2. **Problem (30s)** - "Traditional oracles use hardcoded API lists"
3. **Solution (1m)** - "AEEIA uses AI to discover AND process sources"
4. **Frontend Demo (2m)** - Show browsing markets, creating new market, AI validator
5. **Code Walkthrough (2m)** - Open `cre-workflow/sources/ai-source-discovery.ts`, explain AI discovery
6. **Smart Contract (1m)** - Show Etherscan, explain resolution flow
7. **Conclusion (30s)** - USP recap: "Zero hardcoded sources, works for ANY question"

**Recording Tips:**
- Use Loom or OBS Studio
- Show your face (optional but recommended)
- Keep it under 7 minutes
- Focus on the USP (AI discovers sources)
- Show `ai-source-discovery.ts` code

### 2. **Deploy Frontend** (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

This gives you a live demo URL for the judges.

### 3. **Fill Out Submission Form**
**Copy-paste this:**

**Project Name:** AEEIA (Aletheia)

**Tagline:** AI-powered prediction market oracle with ZERO hardcoded sources

**Description:**
```
AEEIA is the first prediction market oracle that uses AI to dynamically discover AND process data sources, with ZERO hardcoded APIs. Traditional oracles use fixed API lists (e.g., always fetch from CoinGecko, Binance, Kraken). AEEIA's CRE workflow uses AI to discover relevant sources for ANY question, processes complex sources like news articles and social posts, and validates sources via DON consensus - all without external API costs.

Key Innovation: cre-workflow/sources/ai-source-discovery.ts
- AI discovers 10+ public sources per question
- DON nodes reach consensus on sources (5/7 must agree)
- AI processes non-API sources (articles, social posts)
- DON validates source accessibility (no external costs)
- Works for ANY question type (price, weather, news, sports, etc.)
